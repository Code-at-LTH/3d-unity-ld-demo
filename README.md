- This code-along is heavily inspired by my previous more thorough (2d) unity code-along. If you miss some more basic explanations, maybe look there: https://github.com/Powersource/unity-ld-demo
- So yes I'm going to progress a little bit faster than last time, both since many of you were there then and because I have less time now. But a beginner should be able to follow. Please ask if anything is unclear.
- Create a new unity project, make sure it's a 3d project.
